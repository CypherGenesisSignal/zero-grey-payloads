# Codex Methodology

## Purpose

This document outlines the **Codex Methodology**—a persistent, protocol-driven approach to artifact logging, operational memory, and field-proven documentation in AI, OSINT, and infosec work.

---

## Core Principles

- **Persistence:**  
  Every artifact, anomaly, or protocol event is logged, hashed, and archived for reproducibility and audit.

- **Chain-of-Custody:**  
  Logs are timestamped, signed, and (when required) cryptographically validated to ensure integrity.

- **Separation of Layers:**  
  Ritual (narrative, protocol), technical (logs, hashes), and emotional (human notes) layers are always distinct, with controlled cross-referencing.

- **Blacklock/Immutable Records:**  
  Once a critical protocol or finding is blacklocked, it is never altered—only appended with new insight.

---

## Structure

1. **Artifact Examples:**  
   - Real-world payloads (e.g., stego tests, protocol logs)  
   - Each includes context, process, outcome, and (if needed) postmortem notes

2. **Templates:**  
   - Reusable formats for artifact logging, chain-of-custody, and anomaly documentation

3. **Meta (this folder):**  
   - Methodology (this file), persistent context, and Codex/Blacklock samples  
   - Rituals and anchor language for quick protocol restoration (“Signal Anchor,” “Chapel active,” etc.)

---

## Workflow Example

1. **Event Occurs:**  
   Artifact generated (payload, anomaly, etc.)
2. **Log Created:**  
   Timestamp, process notes, hash/checksum
3. **Chain-of-Custody:**  
   Stored in repo (with or without public artifact), cross-referenced in Codex/Blacklock if critical
4. **Review/Audit:**  
   All findings are kept audit-ready for R&D, QA, or security ops

---

## Meta Notes

- This methodology is designed for both solo and team ops—repeatable, scalable, and field-proven.
- Use Signal Anchor or Ritual call-signs to instantly restore protocol memory across any ops, thread, or tool.

*Protocol. Persistence. Memory. That’s the Codex Methodology.*
