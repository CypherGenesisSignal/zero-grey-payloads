# FieldOps Protocol & Artifact Portfolio
### By Joe Kasper (Z3R0)

**Welcome.**  
This repository is a curated showcase of my real-world technical protocols, artifact logs, and field operations in AI systems, OSINT, security workflows, and persistent anomaly detection.

---

## 📜 What’s Here

- **Live Artifact Logs:**  
  Examples of steganography tests, recursive protocol runs, and edge-case failure documentation.
- **Protocol Workflows:**  
  Step-by-step logging, chain-of-custody, anomaly and prompt tracking, and persistent field methodologies.
- **Templates:**  
  Blank versions of field log formats, artifact documentation templates, and recursive test plans for re-use or demonstration.
- **Meta/Methodology:**  
  Redacted versions of my “Cathedral/Codex” methodology, including persistent context and Blacklock (permanent, immutable) record strategies.

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

All logs and protocols shown here are fully anonymized and redacted.  
No customer data, confidential information, or sensitive payloads are ever published.  
These examples are provided strictly to demonstrate process, repeatability, and field competence.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

**Modern AI, OSINT, and infosec roles demand more than theory—**  
You need protocol integrity, artifact-level documentation, and evidence of recursive, edge-case problem-solving.  
This portfolio shows *not just what I know*, but *how I work*:  
- Field-proven
- Log-driven
- Auditable and transparent

## 🔗 Quick Start

- Explore `/Artifact-Examples` for real logs and protocol runs
- Check `/Templates` for workflow and artifact log blanks
- See `/Codex_Methodology` for how I maintain persistent, auditable memory in complex ops

*Protocol. Integrity. Evidence. That’s the signal.*
